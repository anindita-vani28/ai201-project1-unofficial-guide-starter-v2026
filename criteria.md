# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in unit 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"Retrieval works"* is an opinion. *"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that
contains the answer.

**Why this target:**
I chose 4 of 5 because retrieval may not find the best chunk for every question, even when the answer exists in the corpus. Since the campus_life documents cover many different topics, I expect the system to retrieve the correct information for most, but not necessarily all, of my test questions.
---

## 2. Every answer names a source

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**
I chose every answer because source attribution is necessary for users to verify where the information came from. Since the system is designed to answer using retrieved documents, every generated answer should be able to name at least one source.

## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate
stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" —
in at least 4 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**
I chose 4 of 5 because the relevance gate should reject most questions that are unrelated to the campus_life corpus. I allowed one possible mistake because similarity scores may occasionally make an unrelated question appear relevant.
---

## 4. Something about your chunks

At least 4 of 5 sampled chunks should read as a complete thought and contain enough context to understand the information without reading the previous or next chunk.
**Why this target:**
I chose 4 of 5 because the campus_life documents are short and focused, so most chunks should be understandable on their own. I allowed one chunk to be imperfect because some documents may contain multiple related ideas that are difficult to separate cleanly.

---

## 5. Your choice
For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the system should return an answer within 10 seconds after the question is submitted.

**Why this target:**
I chose 4 of 5 because I want the system to respond quickly enough to be practical for a user. I allowed one response to take longer because model calls and retrieval can occasionally vary in processing time.

     UNIT 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
